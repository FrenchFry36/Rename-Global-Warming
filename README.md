The 2024 DANA (Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos) caused unprecedented devastation in Valencia region. 
In a matter of hours, rainfall surpassed 500 liters per square meter in several areas, overwhelming rivers like the Magre and Xúquer, which led to widespread flooding and destruction of infrastructure. This storm caused at least 92 deaths, displaced thousands, and left hundreds missing, with entire neighborhoods submerged and thousands of vehicles stranded.

We build a website letting people come up with a better and more suitable name for such a serious threat. 
We raise awareness. We raise funds to support a GW research/ help people.
