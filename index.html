      <h2>WHY DO I EVEN CARE?</h2>
      <p>
        We are starting to normalise global warming. Its becoming a common
        place. But things are getting worse. Behind these semantically neutral
        (or even positive) words are tragedies and horrifying disasters. We
        caused. Its time to fix it before its too late. Lets start with giving
        it a proper name that reflects its nature.
